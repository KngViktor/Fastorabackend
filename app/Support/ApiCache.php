/**
 * Caches the read-only API responses the Next.js frontend depends on, so a
 * page view costs one cache read instead of a fistful of queries and eager
 * loads. Every endpoint under /api is public, identical for all callers and
 * changes only when an editor saves something, which makes it about the most
 * cacheable thing in the app.
 *
 * Deliberately driver-agnostic. It uses only get/put/increment, never
 * Cache::tags(), because tags are unsupported on the database and file stores
 * and this app has to keep working on shared hosting where Redis may not exist.
 * Point CACHE_STORE at redis and the same code gets faster with no edit.
 *
 * Invalidation is by version counter rather than key deletion. Cached keys are
 * namespaced with a version number; bumping it orphans every old key at once,
 * which is the only approach that can clear a whole group without tag support
 * and without enumerating keys. Orphans expire on their own TTL.
 *
 * The counter is global on purpose. Per-model counters would mean mapping every
 * model to the endpoints it appears in, and a single missed mapping serves
 * stale content indefinitely — a far worse failure than the handful of queries
 * it costs to repopulate everything after any edit.
